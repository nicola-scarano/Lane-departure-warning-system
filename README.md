# Lane-departure-warning-system
The aim of the homework is the implementation of a lane departure warning system that is
based on real-time video procesessing recorded by a camera positioned in front of the vehicle.
The algorithm should raise an alert when the vehicle is approaching the lane delimiters, which
are properly recognized by the framework. The alarm is stopped when the vehicle returns in
the center of the lane. The algorithm has been developed in MATLAB language with a further
addition of Simulink model several experiments have been conducted.
